;;; fsh-check-r4-test.rkt — `raco fsh check` (conformance/ig-check): every problem in an FSH project,
;;; positioned in the FSH. A small project with three planted mistakes must report exactly those, each
;;; at the rule (or instance) that makes it and naming the profile rule it breaks; mCODE 4.0.0's own
;;; sources must check clean (every example against every profile, and the generated server's
;;; requirements for its sender CapabilityStatement).
